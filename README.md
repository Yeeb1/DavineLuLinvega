# CLI tools for quickly sending CLI stuff to Discord channels

A Python package containing CLI tools designed to help in the process of sharing files, tool output, clipboard content, and credentials via Discord during CTFs or competitive hacking events. These tools enable quick and efficient sharing of command output, files, clipboard data, and credential information to designated Discord channels or threads, making team collaboration easier and faster.

## Installation

Install directly from GitHub using pipx (recommended):
```bash
pipx install git+https://github.com/username/DavineLuLinvega.git
```

Or install using uv:
```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/username/DavineLuLinvega.git
```

For development installation:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/DavineLuLinvega.git
cd DavineLuLinvega
pip install -e .
```

## Overview

The `dc` command provides several subcommands for Discord integration:

1. **`dc setup`**: Quick setup wizard for first-time configuration with webhook validation and thread discovery.
2. **`dc manage`**: Manage Discord webhooks, threads, and settings for efficient setup and customization.
3. **`dc log`**: Send terminal command output directly to Discord for real-time collaboration.
4. **`dc send`**: Share files and artifacts with teammates through Discord.
5. **`dc clip`**: Send clipboard content (text, images, or file paths) directly to Discord for quick sharing of results and findings.
6. **`dc creds`**: Share credentials with automated SSH command generation.


## Configuration

Discord CLI uses a centralized JSON configuration system stored at `~/.config/discord-cli/config.json`. This replaces the old `.env` file approach for better organization and features.

### Quick Setup

For first-time setup, use the setup wizard:

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$  dc setup
```

This will guide you through:
- Adding your first webhook with validation
- Discovering and configuring threads
- Setting up your username
- Configuring thread usage preferences

### Manual Configuration

You can also manage configuration manually:

```bash
# Add webhooks
dc manage add-webhook main https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-id/your-webhook-token --default

# Add threads
dc manage add-thread general 123456789012345678 --force

# Configure settings
dc manage set-username YourName
dc manage enable-thread

# View current configuration
dc manage show-config
```

### Migration from .env

If you have an existing `.env` file, it will be automatically migrated:

```bash
dc manage migrate
```

## Commands

### dc setup

â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc manage list-webhooks

# Add a new webhook and set it as the default
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc manage add-webhook HTB-Machines https://discord.com/api/webhooks/12345/abcdef --default

# Set an existing webhook as default
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc manage set-default-webhook HTB-Machines

# List all threads
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc manage list-threads

# Add a new thread and set it as default
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc manage add-thread Reaper 987654321098765432 --force
```

### dc log

This script captures the output of a terminal command and sends it to Discord. If the output is longer than 2000 characters, it sends the output as a file.

#### Usage

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc log [-c COMMENT] <command>
```

#### Options

- `-c, --comment`: Optional comment to include with the output.
- `<command>`: The terminal command to execute.

#### Examples

```bash
# Send output of the `ls` command
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc log -c "Listing directory" ls -la

# Send content of a file to Discord
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc log cat large_file.txt
```

#### Quick Usage

With an alias set up, you can use the `!!` command in combination with an alias like `dl` to send the output of your last terminal command directly to Discord.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ ls -la
# You want to send this output to Discord
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dl !!
```

- **`!!`** repeats the last command you executed.
- **`dl !!`** runs `dc log` with the output of the previous command, sending it directly to your Discord channel.

### dc send

This script uploads files to Discord using a webhook.

#### Usage

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc send <file> [-c COMMENT]
```

#### Options

- `<file>`: The path of the file to upload.
- `-c, --comment`: Optional comment to include with the file.

#### Examples

```bash
# Send a file with a comment
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc send report.pdf -c "Here is the report"

# Send a file without a comment
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc send backup.zip
```

### dc clip

This script sends the current clipboard content to Discord. It can handle text, images, and file paths copied to the clipboard.

#### Usage

Run `dc clip` without any arguments to send the current clipboard content to Discord.

```bash
â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
â””â”€$ dc clip
```

### Examples

- If the clipboard contains text, it sends the text directly:
  ```bash
  â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
  â””â”€$ dc clip
  Clipboard content sent successfully.
  ```
- If the clipboard contains an image, it uploads the image as a file:
  ```bash
  â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
  â””â”€$ dc clip
  Image sent successfully.
  ```
- If the clipboard contains a file path (e.g., `file:///path/to/file.txt`), it uploads the file:
  ```bash
  â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliðŸ˜ˆkali)-[~/DavineLuLinvega]
  â””â”€$ dc clip
  File sent successfully.
  ```

### dc creds
